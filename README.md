# HORD

HORD stands for Hyperparameter Optimization using RBF and Dynamic coordinate search.
It's an optimization method mostly used on Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
The big difference is has is that it necessarily requires less function evaluations, against other available algorithms, which saves you lots of time / cost!
